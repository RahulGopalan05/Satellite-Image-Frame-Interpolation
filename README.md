# AI-Based Video Frame Interpolation for Satellite Imagery

**Project for Smart India Hackathon 2024**

This repository contains the implementation of an AI-driven system designed for **frame interpolation of satellite imagery**, creating smooth video visualizations by generating intermediate frames between satellite images. The project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction and explores **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **spatio-temporal models** for advanced frame interpolation techniques.

## **Project Overview**

As part of the **Smart India Hackathon 2024**, this project aims to enhance satellite imagery visualizations by generating intermediate frames between consecutive frames, allowing smoother transitions and more fluid visualization of dynamic objects such as clouds, weather patterns, and other environmental changes.

### **Core Features:**

- **Frame Interpolation**: Uses a Super SloMo-based CNN model to generate intermediate frames between satellite images.
- **Advanced Models**: Explores **GANs** and **spatio-temporal models** to improve the quality and consistency of interpolated frames (work-in-progress).
- **High-Resolution Output**: Generates high-quality interpolated frames that enhance the visual continuity of satellite imagery.

## **Tech Stack:**

- **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, CNN, GANs, Spatio-Temporal Models
- **Data**: Satellite Imagery (using datasets from VEDAS/MOSDAC/BHUVAN)
